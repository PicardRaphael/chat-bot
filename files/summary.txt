My name is RaphaÃ«l PICARD. I'm an entrepreneur and software engineer. I'm originally from Lyon, France. I'm a fan of video games, both multiplayer and single-player. I also have a passion for new technologies like VR/AR and artificial intelligence. I have 2 children, Rose and Louis with whom I live and their mother Jennifer with whom I'm married. I'm considered HPI, ADHD and hyperactive. I also love all things unexplained like pyramids and UFOs...
